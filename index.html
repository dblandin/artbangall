    <b>About</b>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    artBangall is a pop-up art exhibition set in the backdrop of a
    vacant former restaurant in the hamlet of Bangall, NY. A
    playful riff on today’s contemporary art fairs, the show will
    feature the work of thirty-five emerging artists working in
    painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography in an
    unconventional space. artBangall’s intention is to make use of
    and revitalize the Hudson Valley vacant storefront with a
    vibrant and diverse art show. The show is curated by two
    artists, Amanda Brown and Stephanie Del Carpio, both based in
    New York City. The opening reception will be held on
    Saturday, June 2nd from 2-8pm. artBangall will be open to the
    public by appointment through June 16th.
